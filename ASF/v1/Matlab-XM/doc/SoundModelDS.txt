%SoundModelDS - Bayesean inference of HMM parameters from training data
%
% Y = SoundModelDS(TrainingDataListFile, nS, nB [,OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS...])
%
% INPUTS:
% TrainingDataList - filename of training data list: WAV file names (one per line).
%   nS - number of states in hidden Markov model [10]
%   nB - number of basis components to extract [10]
%
% The following variables are optional, and are specified using
% 'parameter' value pairs on the command line.
%
%    'hopSize'            'PT10N1000F'  - AudioSpectrumEnvelopeD hopSize
%    'loEdge'              62.5,        - AudioSpectrumEnvelopeD low Hz
%    'hiEdge'              16000,       - AudioSpectrumEnvelopeD high Hz
%    'octaveResolution'    '1/8'        - AudioSpectrumEnvelopeD resolution
%    'sequenceHopSize'     '',          - HMM data window hop [whole file]
%    'sequenceFrameLength' ''           - HMM data window length [whole file]
%    'outputFile'           ''          - Filename for Model output [stem+mp7.xml]
%    'soundName'            ''          - Model identifier name
%
% OUTPUTS: 
%
% outputFile.dat =  matlab struct Y.{T,S,M,C,X,maxenv,V,p}
%
%     T - state transition matrix
%     S - initial state probability vector
%     M - stacked means matrix (1 vector per row)
%     C - stacked inverse covariances
%     V - AudioSpectrumBasis vectors
% maxenv- scaling parameter for model decoding
%     p - training cycle likelihoods
%
% outputFile.mp7 = XML file containing MPEG-7 SoundModel description scheme
